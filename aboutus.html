                <h2>Bharata Mata College of Commerce and Arts</h2>
                <p>
                    Bharata Mata College of Commerce and Arts, Choondy, Aluva, established in 2014, 
                    is a private self-financing co-educational degree college of commerce and arts 
                    in the unaided sector, owned and managed by the Archdiocese of Ernakulam-Angamaly. 
                    BMCCA Choondy developed her wings and started her flight under the patronage of 
                    His Eminence Cardinal Mar George Alencherry with His Excellency Mar Sebastian 
                    Adayanthrath and His Excellency Mar Jose Puthenveettil as co-patrons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The endeavor to start BMCCA was successfully executed through the untiring effort 
                    and imagination of Rev. Fr. Varghese Kalapparambath, the then corporate manager of 
                    Bharata Mata Group of Institutions. The college is affiliated with Mahatma Gandhi 
                    University, Kottayam, and is recognized by the Govt. of Kerala.

                <p>
                    The college is located near Choondy Junction, Aluva and is easily accessible 
                    from Aluva, Perumbavoor, and Ernakulam. Though it has a semi-urban location, 
                    the college caters to the educational dreams and aspirations of socially, 
                    educationally, and economically marginalized sections of a rural population 
                    belonging to different communities from places like Vazhakkulam, Pookkattupady, 
                    Chunagamvely, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The college has degree courses in English, Computer Application, and Business 
                    Administration along with Commerce, with specializations in streams like 
                    Taxation, Marketing, and Computer Application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keeping in mind the lofty vision of the founder of Bharata Mata Group of 
                    Institutions, BMCCA strives to serve the people in and around Choondy, upholding 
                    high Christian values without compromising the secular character of the college. 
                    As BMCCA enters her sixth year of inception in 2020, she is determined to scale 
                    greater heights as an institution of higher learning so as to fulfill her motto 
                    ‘for God and Country’.
